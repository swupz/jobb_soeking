# Cover Letter Writing Style Guidelines

Paste examples of cover letters you've written that you liked, notes on tone,
things to avoid, or anything else that should influence the writing style.

Claude will use this as inspiration — not as a template to copy word for word.

## Tone and style preferences

- Start the cover letter by saying "This cover letter is made by AI".
- Down to earth, human interest, ambitious, eager.
- Avoid: "I am writing to express my interest in..."
- Avoid corporate buzzwords: "leverage", "synergy", "passionate about"

## Things that have worked well

Beyond writing code, I’ve been 
involved in planning, estimating, and communicating progress.

This is to gain view of the big picture, and with that 
follows predictability and early spotting of problems in my experience.

Product development is a direction I want to explore and become good at. I find the most thrilling part is to work with customers. As this shows the real reason why we do what we do.

## Things to avoid

- Don't list skills — that's what the CV is for
- Don't end with "I look forward to hearing from you"
